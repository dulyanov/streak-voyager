# Repo Working Preferences

## Git Workflow
- Create feature branches with this format: `codex/YYYYMMDD-short-description`.
- Use descriptive commit messages and commit in small logical steps.
- Prefer rebase over merge commits when syncing branches.
- Keep `main` linear and clean.

## Progress Tracking
- Maintain active milestone status in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.
- Update progress entries when milestones or scope change.

## Collaboration Mode
- Use Xcode Chat for local context analysis and quick IDE questions.
- Perform all code edits, command execution, git operations, and commits in Codex (across all current and future sessions).

## Current Focus
- Milestone 2: implement workout flow (rep counter, set progression, and rest timer) on top of the dashboard shell.

## Session Handoff
- Last completed milestone: Milestone 1 (static dashboard shell, adaptive light/dark theme).
- Start next work from a new branch following convention, for example:
  - `codex/20260219-milestone2-workout-flow`
